# Github Actions Quick Examples.

## About Repository:

This is a fundamental repository I've set up to explore GitHub actions, focusing on:

- Installation of Node packages
- Execution of a Node script within custom actions
- Testing if statements
- Modifying global environment variables during job execution
- Finally, retrieving and displaying the environment variable via a Node script.
